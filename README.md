# Conway's Game of Life Simulation

Welcome to Conway's Game of Life Simulation project! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The simulation is created using HTML, CSS, and JS, allowing you to explore the complex patterns that emerge from simple rules.

## Live Site
Check out the game of life on: https://gameoflifep5.netlify.app/

## Features
- **User Interaction:** Interact with the simulation using intuitive buttons.
  - **Start Button:** Begin the simulation.
  - **Stop Button:** Pause the simulation.
  - **Randomize Button:** Randomly populate the grid with live and dead cells.

## Work in Progress

- **Logic Gates Page (Coming Soon):** Currently working on adding a separate page showcasing logic gates incorporated inside the Game of Life simulation.
